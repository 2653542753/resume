This is a simple resume in Markdown.  You can create PDF and HTML versions by
running `make` if you have the document processor
[Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) installed.  Modify resume.css to
change the appearance of the HTML output and header.tex for the PDF output.

The Makefile assumes pandoc >= 1.9, but this can easily be changed.
