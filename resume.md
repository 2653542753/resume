Work Experience
---------------

*   **Markdown with Pandoc**

    Resumé Architect, February 2011 - present

    -   Write in one format (Markdown), convert to many formats (PDF, HTML, .odt,
        .docx, and more)

    -   Style your HTML with CSS and your PDF with a custom \LaTeX\ header

    -   Uses `resume.py`, a simple pre-processor that lets you extract parts of
        the Markdown and define per-format operations on these parts.  For
        example, extract the contact info and put it in a right-aligned block in
        the top right in both HTML and PDF (\LaTeX).

    -   You get a text-based resumé for free if you need one in a pinch for a web
        form somewhere

    -   Maintain different contexts of your resumé on different Github branches

*   **LinkedIn, StackOverflow Careers**

    Resumé Intern, August 2010

    -   PDF export is not very customizable

    -   Lots of stuff you don't want or need

*   **LaTeX + pdflatex**

    Senior Resumé Maker, 2008 - 2010

    -   Lots of markup obscures your content, even if it is largely semantic
        instead of presentational

    -   The best-looking \LaTeX\ resumés require unusual TeX setups

*   **Word Processor** (Redmond, WA)

    Junior Resumé Maker, 2006 - 2007

    -   No separation of presentation and content

    -   Have to "print to PDF" anyway

    -   Styling is a pain, so you either don't do it or find a half-decent
        template and don't mess with it
